The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations.

In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page.

The file you must use in creating your data visualizations is the flights.csv file. The other two provided files may be used in conjunction with the flights.csv file, but should not be used alone.

You are required to create three visualizations. Some questions you may attempt to answer include those pertaining to the following areas:

Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?
Determine which destinations and arrival destinations have the most delays? Doing this using maps is actually pretty difficult, but you may choose an alternative visual to provide this information. Think about what kind of aggregates might work best to determine which airlines and airports are the best and worst in terms of delays.

What causes delays?
Think about if you work at an airline and you want to decrease delays. What part of the flight causes the most delays? Do these causes vary by airport or time of year?

You can also come up with your own question!
As you work with the data, come up with a question you're curious about and can be answered from the data. Build a dashboard or story to answer your question and lead viewers to that answer.

Review the column Metadata
Some of the columns you want to use in your project will have coded values that represent longer more readable values. For instance the cancellation_reason column in the flights data set has the values: A, B, C, D These letters are not understandable by themselves. You need to replace these letters with the full reason to make your visualizations including this data more readable.

These letters correspond with the following reasons.

A - Airline/Carrier

B - Weather

C - National Air System

D - Security

You should review the Column Metadata tab on Kaggle for each data set to find details about the data like the one I have outlined above.
